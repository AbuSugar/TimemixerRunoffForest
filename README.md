## Introduction
üèÜ **TimeMixer**, as a fully MLP-based architecture, taking full advantage of disentangled multiscale time series, is proposed to **achieve consistent SOTA performances in both long and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency**.

üåü**Observation 1: History Extraction** 

Given that seasonal and trend components exhibit significantly different characteristics in time series, and different scales of the time series reflect different properties, with seasonal characteristics being more pronounced at a fine-grained micro scale and trend characteristics being more pronounced at a coarse macro scale, it is therefore necessary to decouple seasonal and trend components at different scales.

üåü**Observation 2: Future Prediction** 

Integrating forecasts from different scales to obtain the final prediction results, different scales exhibit complementary predictive capabilities.

## Overall Architecture
TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with **Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM)** and **Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM)** blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases.

### Past Decomposable Mixing 
we propose the **Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM)** block to mix the decomposed seasonal and trend components in multiple scales separately.

</p>

Empowered by seasonal and trend mixing, PDM progressively aggregates the detailed seasonal information from fine to coarse and dive into the macroscopic trend information with prior knowledge from coarser scales, eventually achieving the multiscale mixing in past information extraction.

### Future Multipredictor Mixing 
Note that **Future Multipredictor Mixing (FMM)** is an ensemble of multiple predictors, where different predictors are based on past information from different scales, enabling FMM to integrate complementary forecasting capabilities of mixed multiscale series.

## Get Started

1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Download data. You can download the all datasets from [datasets](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1NF7VEefXCmXuWNbnNe858WvQAkJ_7wuP&export=download). **All the datasets are well pre-processed** and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimeMixer_ETTm1.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ECL_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Traffic_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Solar_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Weather_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/M4/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/PEMS/TimeMixer.sh
```

## Main Results
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and efficiency of TimeMixer, covering long-term and short-term forecasting, including 18 real-world benchmarks and 15 baselines.
