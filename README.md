## Get Started

1. Install requirements. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Download data. You can download all the datasets from [Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy). **All the datasets are well pre-processed** and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts`. You can reproduce the experiment results by:

```bash
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimeMixer_ETTm1.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ECL_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Traffic_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Solar_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Weather_script/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/M4/TimeMixer_M4.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/PEMS/TimeMixer.sh
```
